# Springboard Bootcamp Projects

There are various projects that I worked on during my time at Springboard. 

We worked on the following topics:
- [Data Science Pipeline](https://github.com/naturesbless/SpringboardMay2022/tree/main/Data%20Science%20Pipeline)
- [Regression Algorithms](https://github.com/naturesbless/SpringboardMay2022/tree/main/Regression%20Algorithm%20Practice)
- [Clustering Algorithms ](https://github.com/naturesbless/SpringboardMay2022/tree/main/Clustering%20Algorithm%20Practice)
- [Decision Tree Algorithms ](https://github.com/naturesbless/SpringboardMay2022/tree/main/Tree%20Classifiers)
- [Time Series Analysis ](https://github.com/naturesbless/SpringboardMay2022/tree/main/TimeSeries_CowboysCigarettesCaseStudy)
- [SQL Project](https://github.com/naturesbless/SpringboardMay2022/tree/main/SQLCaseStudy)
- [Hyperparameter Tuning](https://github.com/naturesbless/SpringboardMay2022/tree/main/Hyperparameter%20Tuning%20Practice)

Some of my favorite projects from each section will be briefly described below. Each page will have a more detailed readme on each of the individual projects.


## Data Science Pipeline
This folder is designed to contain general projects related to the data science pipeline such as exploring APIs, creating presentations, and the fundamental steps in data science.

The [**London Borough**](https://github.com/naturesbless/SpringboardMay2022/tree/main/Data%20Science%20Pipeline/LondonBoroughs) case study was my favorite as it was one of the first forays I made into data science. We analyzed data from the London boroughs and did basic analysis. Within this folder we also performed some API calls on the NASDAQ API and explored that data on a surface level.

One of my favorite things was the ability to use some data visualization to explore our data.

## Regression Algorithms
This folder focuses on projects focused on regression analysis. Presently, we have explored linear and logistic regression. Of these two projects, I think the linear regression case study was my favorite.

Within the [linear regression case study](https://github.com/naturesbless/SpringboardMay2022/tree/main/Regression%20Algorithm%20Practice/Linear%20Regression), we explored the Red Wine database and created multiple linear regression modlels. This gave me my first foray into exploring adjusting models and understanding the process of performing analysis. In each case study we went through the steps of loading, cleaning, visualizing the data, and tuning the models after testing them.

## Clustering Algorithms
In this folder, we look at the foundations of clustering algorithms such as Euclidean vs Manhattan distance, cosine similarity, and k-means algorithms. In cosine similarity, we learned to use it for comparing similarities between sentences using tf-idf. My favorite project would be the k-means project.

In the [k-means project](https://github.com/naturesbless/SpringboardMay2022/tree/main/Clustering%20Algorithm%20Practice/K-Means%20Clustering) we went through the entire process of creating a k-means clustering algoritm. The case study described the fundamentals of how k-means works and ran through some methods for optimizing and measuring the effectiveness of the algorithm. We created scree plots to find optimal clusters and even did silhouette analysis as a means of measuring performance.
