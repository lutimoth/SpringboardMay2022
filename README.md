# Springboard Bootcamp Projects

There are various projects that I worked on during my time at Springboard. 

We worked on the following topics:
- [Data Science Pipeline](https://github.com/naturesbless/SpringboardMay2022/tree/main/Data%20Science%20Pipeline)
- [Regression Algorithms](https://github.com/naturesbless/SpringboardMay2022/tree/main/Regression%20Algorithm%20Practice)
- [Clustering Algorithms ](https://github.com/naturesbless/SpringboardMay2022/tree/main/Clustering%20Algorithm%20Practice)
- [Decision Tree Algorithms ](https://github.com/naturesbless/SpringboardMay2022/tree/main/Tree%20Classifiers)
- [Time Series Analysis ](https://github.com/naturesbless/SpringboardMay2022/tree/main/TimeSeries_CowboysCigarettesCaseStudy)
- [SQL Project](https://github.com/naturesbless/SpringboardMay2022/tree/main/SQLCaseStudy)
- [Hyperparameter Tuning](https://github.com/naturesbless/SpringboardMay2022/tree/main/Hyperparameter%20Tuning%20Practice)

Some of my favorite projects from each section will be briefly described below. Each page will have a more detailed readme on each of the individual projects.


## Data Science Pipeline
This folder is designed to contain general projects related to the data science pipeline such as exploring APIs, creating presentations, and the fundamental steps in data science.

The London Borough case study was my favorite as it was one of the first forays I made into data science. We analyzed data from the London boroughs and did basic analysis. Within this folder we also performed some API calls on the NASDAQ API and explored that data on a surface level.

One of my favorite things was the ability to use some data visualization to explore our data.
